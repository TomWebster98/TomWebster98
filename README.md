-----------------------------------

MPhys Physics with Astrophysics graduate with a high first-class degree from the University of Sussex. Experienced in control software engineering, systems engineering, material mechanics testing and experimental design; in addition to STEM outreach and communications. Currently working towards a chartership in engineering (CEng) with the IET.

Passionate about Motorsport engineering and strategy, particularly Formula 1 and BTCC. Current projects focus on **race strategy data analysis, control system modelling, and MATLAB/Simulink.**

### What I'm Doing:

- 🛠 &nbsp; I mainly work with Python, utilising modules like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, dash and plotly for data processing and visualisation.
- 🌱 &nbsp; I’m currently learning MATLAB/Simulink and Motorsport engineering topics such as vehicle dynamics, aerodynamics and race strategy.
- 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; My personal projects are available on [GitHub.](https://github.com/TomWebster98?tab=repositories)
