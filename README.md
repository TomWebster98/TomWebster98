-----------------------------------

Energy Management Controls Engineer for Mahindra Racing Formula E Team, MSc Advanced Motorsport Mechatronics student at Cranfield University, and first-class MPhys Physics with Astrophysics graduate from the University of Sussex. Experienced in control systems and software engineering, model-based system architecture, material mechanics testing and experimental design; in addition to STEM outreach and communications. Currently working towards a chartership in engineering (CEng) with the IET.

Passionate about Motorsport race strategy, vehicle dynamics and controls. Current projects focus on **F1 race strategy data analysis, race strategy optimisation, Formula E Monte Carlo race strategy simulation development (MSc Thesis).**

### What I'm Doing:

- 📚 &nbsp; Completing an MSc in Advanced Motorsport Mechatronics at Cranfield University (09/2023 - 09/2024).
- 🛠 &nbsp; I mainly work with MATLAB, Simulink, and Python, specifically for data processing, visualisation, and analysis, or control system design.
- 🌱 &nbsp; I’m learning new techniques in race strategy analysis and optimisation, completing my MSc Thesis with a focus on Monte Carlo simulation development for Gen3 Formula E.
- 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; My personal projects are available on [GitHub.](https://github.com/TomWebster98?tab=repositories)
