-----------------------------------

MSc Advanced Motorsport Mechatronics student at Cranfield University and first-class MPhys Physics with Astrophysics graduate from the University of Sussex. Experienced in control systems and software engineering, model-based system architecture, material mechanics testing and experimental design; in addition to STEM outreach and communications. Currently working towards a chartership in engineering (CEng) with the IET.

Passionate about Motorsport race strategy, vehicle dynamics and controls. Current projects focus on **F1 race strategy data analysis, race strategy optimisation, and vehicle dynamics modelling with MATLAB/Simulink.**

### What I'm Doing:

- 📚 &nbsp; Completing an MSc in Advanced Motorsport Mechatronics at Cranfield University (09/2023 - 09/2024).
- 🛠 &nbsp; I mainly work with Model-Based Engineering tools, such as Capella and Simulink, in addition to high-level programming languages such as MATLAB and Python, specifically utilising Python modules like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, dash and plotly for data processing and visualisation.
- 🌱 &nbsp; I’m learning new techniques in race strategy analysis and optimisation, completing my MSc thesis with a focus on the application Monte-Carlo techniques to this area
- 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; My personal projects are available on [GitHub.](https://github.com/TomWebster98?tab=repositories)
