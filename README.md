-----------------------------------

Strategy Simulation Engineer for Envision Racing Formula E Team, MSc Advanced Motorsport Mechatronics graduate from Cranfield University, and first-class MPhys Physics with Astrophysics graduate from the University of Sussex. Experienced in motorsport race strategy, control systems and software engineering, in addition to STEM outreach and communications. Currently working towards a Chartership in Engineering (CEng) with the IET.

My GitHub repositories are a combination of personal hobbie projects which focus on **F1 race strategy data analysis and race strategy optimisation**, in addition to some self study notes on **Vehicle Dynamics Modelling and Simulation**, and some work which was completed as part of the MSc at Cranfield. My Thesis involved the development of Monte Carlo simulations for Gen3 Formula E competition, and the subsequent analysis and optimisation of race strategy. This work is currently contained in a private repository.
